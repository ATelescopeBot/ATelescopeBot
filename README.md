<p align=center>A Discord bot for those who are tired of all these bad bots out there.</p>
 
## ğŸ’¡About
The main point with this project is offering you a bot that you can trust.

A bot that will never be inconvenient and won't ask you for money,
If you either want or not to donate for this project, there is no difference,
But if you choose to do, it'll be an incentive for us to keep going.
